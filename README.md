This is a repository for files of (at now) unfinished photography blog project. It Involves:

- Responsivity [with hamburger menu in mobile devices till around 1k px width] [hamburger in progress]
- Admin Panel with CMS [now i am in middle of it, trying to transfer files and content to server. Adding Blog section works. Must add other]
- WYSIWYG [working]
TO DO:
- Finish hamburger menu
- finish adding data to tables in pdo php
- create section for destroying data inside tables by admin panel
- Create Cookies and Privacy Policy on site
- create forum with comment, login(start hashing this passwords!)
- Add to WYSIWYG some voting label (i am thinking about it)
- control the web traffic and gatter that data, display in Admin Panel Statystics section.

- And everything what's gona come to my brain and it's valuable, also can take some opinions in consideration.
